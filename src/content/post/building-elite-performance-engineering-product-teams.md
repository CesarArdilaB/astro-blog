Having an elite-performance engineering team is the dream of every lead, manager, or project manager. But what does that entail? How can you determine if your team is performing well or poorly? I’m sure you’ve had these questions at some point, so let’s try to define what ‘performance’ means in the context of engineering and product teams. This is not easy because these teams have to undertake various tasks such as paying off technical debt, releasing new features, fixing bugs, checking the backlog, designing new features, running experiments, joining meetings, and achieving deadlines. Over time, I’ve tried different approaches to define a solid strategy. The following paragraphs will illustrate how I manage to build an elite-performing and highly motivated team.

## Understanding the Dynamics of Engineering/Product Teams

The first thing you need to understand is that product and software development are social activities. As such, they involve people, and as you know, each person is unique. Therefore, before considering the implementation of Kanban, Scrum, or any other methodologies, your focus should be on your team members. Getting to know them is crucial, and the best way to achieve this is through regular 1:1 sessions. You can start by scheduling these meetings weekly, eventually adjusting the frequency to once a month, depending on the specific case.

The aim of these sessions is to understand the individual’s expectations, ambitions, and, most importantly, what motivates them the most. Is it the product they’re working on? Their love for experimenting with new technologies? The type of problems they’re solving? The chance to grow by learning from their teammates? And it’s not just about their professional life. Consider their personality: Are they shy or extroverted? An early bird or a night owl? Understanding these aspects will help you tailor your approach to each team member, fostering a more productive and harmonious work environment.

## Instilling Confidence and Psychological Safety

Once you truly understand your team, the next step is to instill confidence in them. As social beings, confidence empowers us and provides the security needed to face difficult challenges. Here are some strategies you can employ to ensure your team feels your complete trust:

- Assigning tasks according to their technical and seniority level.
- Allowing them to give you the specific task deadline (it’s up to you to be consistent and not add another task in the middle).
- Giving them the whole task context so they understand why it is important, realizing they are generating real value.

And the most important social component is psychological safety. You must define an environment where every single team member feels confident to challenge the status quo, ask questions, make proposals, admit errors, and experiment with adventurous actions.

## Motivating Through Personal Development and Recognition

To inspire and sustain high performance, understanding what drives each team member is crucial. Motivation can come from various sources — personal growth, the impact of their work, team dynamics, or external rewards. Here are some strategies to consider:

- **Personal Development Plans**: Work with each team member to create a personal development plan that aligns with their career aspirations and the team’s goals.
- **Recognition and Rewards**: Implement a system to recognize and reward contributions and achievements. This doesn’t always mean financial incentives; sometimes, public recognition or additional responsibilities can be just as motivating.
- **Creating a Sense of Ownership**: Encourage team members to take ownership of projects. This builds a sense of pride in their work and invests them in the outcome.

## Diving Into DevOps and DORA Metrics

Understanding and implementing DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics is crucial for engineering and product teams aiming for high performance. These metrics offer insights into software delivery performance, highlighting areas for improvement and showcasing the team’s success in deploying features to production efficiently and safely. This section will cover how to start measuring these metrics and why they are essential for a frictionless deployment process, including deploying on a Friday without issues.

## Emphasizing Product Metrics and Continuous Improvement

Positive outcomes from product metrics not only demonstrate the team’s success but also motivate them to push further. It’s vital to listen to all proposals and reduce barriers to innovation. This segment will explore how product metrics can drive team performance and the importance of adopting a management style that fits the context.

## Cultivating a Supportive and Respectful Team Environment

Discussing the significance of regular meetings, development cycles, and ceremonies worth having will help in maintaining a supportive team environment. Recognizing everyone’s contributions highlights the interdependence within the team and reinforces the importance of psychological safety and respect. This part will delve into the challenges of scaling the team and the perpetual journey towards improvement.

## Conclusion

Building and managing an elite-performance engineering/product team requires a deep understanding of individual motivations, fostering a culture of trust and psychological safety, and implementing effective methodologies and metrics
